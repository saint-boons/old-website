## Missleading information

Please do not contact me unless you have something that is worth and appropriate to share with me. For example, I do not care that you lost your keys last week. I prefer hearing something like "Image X on page X is not loading, I tried multiple times".

## Hate

If you don't like me and you are creating isues on GitHub or spamming me with emails/Discord DMs just don't brother, it doesn't do much on mental state (actually nothing... I already get engough notifications a day)

## Thank you
